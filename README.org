* Urlisp
  This is a sparse implementation of Lisp in PHP. It includes macros,
  in the form of FEXPRs (functions that do not evaluate their
  arguments), and a small set of pre-defined functions. A REPL web
  page is also included for testing purposes.

* Usage
  Fire up a PHP-enabled web server and point it at this
  directory. Point your web browser at =/repl.php= and watch the
  magic!
